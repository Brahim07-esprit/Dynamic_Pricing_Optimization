Introduction
Dynamic pricing is a strategy where businesses adjust the prices of their products or services in response to market demands, competition, and other external factors. This project implements a reinforcement learning approach to optimize pricing strategies for multiple products over time, aiming to maximize total profit.
Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:
Import Libraries: Importing necessary Python libraries.
Environment Setup: Defining products, market dynamics, and simulating customer behavior.
Reinforcement Learning Framework: Defining state, action, and reward structures.
Implement the Environment: Creating the pricing environment for the agent to interact with.
Develop the RL Agent: Implementing a Deep Q-Network (DQN) and experience replay.
Training the Agent: Training the agent over multiple episodes.
Evaluation: Analyzing the agent's performance and comparing it to a baseline strategy.

Simulation Environment
Products and Market Dynamics
We define a set of products, each with:
Cost: The production cost of the product.
Base Price: The standard selling price.
Price Range: Minimum and maximum allowable prices.

Example products:
Product A: Cost $30, Base Price $50
Product B: Cost $20, Base Price $40
Product C: Cost $50, Base Price $80
Product D: Cost $15, Base Price $25
Product E: Cost $100, Base Price $150

Market dynamics include:
Max Demand: The maximum potential demand.
Price Sensitivity: How demand changes with price.
Sigma: Standard deviation for demand fluctuation.

Customer Behavior Simulation
Customer demand is simulated using an exponential decay function influenced by price and random fluctuations:

Reinforcement Learning Framework
State, Action, and Reward Definitions
State: Current prices of all products.
Action: Price adjustments for each product.
Reward: Total profit for the current time step.

Evaluation
Training Progress
Training metrics are plotted to visualize learning progress:
Total Reward per Episode
Total Profit per Episode

Pricing Strategies Analysis
The agent's pricing strategies over time are analyzed and plotted for each product.
Baseline Comparison
The RL agent's performance is compared against a baseline strategy with no price adjustments.

Total Profit - RL Agent: $2,919,129.40
Total Profit - Baseline Strategy: $2,177,019.50

Conclusion
The reinforcement learning agent successfully learned dynamic pricing strategies that significantly improved total profit compared to the baseline. By adjusting prices in response to simulated market dynamics, the agent optimized the balance between price and demand.
